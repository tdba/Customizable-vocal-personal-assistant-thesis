# Customizable-vocal-personal-assistant-thesis

Since 2007 and the introduction of SIRI, there are more and more intelligent personal assistants appearing. The enthusiasm comes from their ability to manage several aspects of our life. Some of them such as Siri or Cortana are developed by big companies but there are also others developed as open-source or individual projects like Jarvis or Lucida.

Even though they gain more and more capabilities with the years and upgrades, they are still eventually hitting the limits of the software. We are limited by which functionalities they allow us to run and the programmed capabilities. The same goes for the social capabilities that are limited to encoded answers that we can not expand. The focus of this work is to go beyond these limits and allow the user to customise his own assistant with functions responding to his needs.

We will first proceed to the creation of a new intelligent personal assistant with basic functions. We will then add a macro recorder to enable an user to add functionalities to the programmed ones. This whole recording process should be feasible by no-programmer users.
